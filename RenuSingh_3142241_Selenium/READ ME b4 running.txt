This file just contains the Instructions and the Guidelines showing the Code flow.

Steps for Eclipse Opening & Running :-
1. Firstly, copy the Maven project (POM Demo) to your system.
2. Open the Maven project in the eclipse
3. Check/Verify the Config File (config.properties) under src/main/resources

5.Please navigate to any testng.xml file in the project and run as TestNG Suite
6. We can also run as Maven
Save the SchoolSystem project in Eclipse.
7. Run and POMDemo project and observe the result in Extent reports > POMDemo\extent-reports folder.

8. Also, observe that the test execution results (test-output content) are stored in the folders:
- TestExecution_ArchiveResults > Archive of all run results are stored with Date-Timestamp
- TestExecution_CurrentResults > Stores the current run result with Date-Timestamp of the execution.
